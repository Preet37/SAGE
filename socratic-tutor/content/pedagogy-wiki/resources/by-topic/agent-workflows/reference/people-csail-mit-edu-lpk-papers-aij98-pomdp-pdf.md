Abstract 

In this paper, we bring techniques from operations research to bear on the problem of choosing optimal actions in partially observable stochastic domains. We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes ( MDP s) and partially observable MDP s ( POMDP s). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving POMDP s off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP . We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to POMDP s, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions.  1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The robot can move from hallway intersection to intersection and can make local observations of its world. Its actions are not completely reliable, however. Sometimes, when it intends to move, it stays where it is or goes too far; sometimes, when it intends to turn, it overshoots. It has similar problems with observation. Sometimes a corridor looks like a corner; sometimes a T-junction looks like an L-junction. How can such an error-plagued robot navigate, even given a map of the corridors?

In general, the robot will have to remember something about its history of actions and observations and use this information, together with its knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the world (the map and other information), to maintain an estimate of its location. Many engineering applications follow this approach, using methods like the Kalman filter [26] to maintain a running estimate of the robot’s spatial uncertainty, expressed as an ellipsoid or normal distribution in Cartesian space. This approach will not do for our robot, though. Its uncertainty may be discrete: it might be almost certain that it is in the north-east corner of either the fourth or the seventh floors, though it admits a chance that it is on the fifth floor, as well. Then, given an uncertain estimate of its location, the robot has to decide what actions to take. In some cases, it might be sufficient to ignore its uncertainty and take actions that would be appropriate for the most likely location. In other cases, it might be better for the robot to take actions for the purpose of gathering information, such as searching for a landmark or reading signs on the wall. In general, it will take actions that fulfill both purposes simultaneously. 

1. Introduction 

In this paper, we bring techniques from operations research to bear on the problem of choosing optimal actions in partially observable stochastic domains. Problems like the one described above can be modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes 

( POMDP s). Of course, we are not interested only in problems of robot navigation. Similar problems come up in factory process control, oil exploration, transportation logistics, and a variety of other complex real-world situations. This is essentially a planning problem: given a complete and correct model of the world dynamics and a reward structure, find an optimal way to behave. In the artificial intelligence (AI) literature, a deterministic version of this problem has been addressed by adding knowledge preconditions to traditional planning systems [43]. Because we are interested in stochastic domains, however, we must depart from the traditional AI planning model. Rather than taking plans to be sequences of actions, which may only rarely execute as expected, we take them to be mappings from situations to actions that specify the agent’s behavior no matter what may happen. In many cases, we may not want a full policy; methods for developing partial policies and conditional plans for completely observable domains are the subject of much current interest [13,15,61]. A weakness of the methods described in this paper is that they require the states of the world to be represented enumeratively, rather than through compositional representations such as Bayes nets or probabilistic operator descriptions. However, this work has served as a substrate for development of algorithms for more complex and efficient representations [6]. Section 6 describes the relation between the present approach and prior research in more detail. One important facet of the POMDP approach is that there is no distinction drawn between actions taken to change the state of the world and actions taken to gain information. This is important because, in general, every action has both types of effect. Stopping to ask questions may delay the robot’s arrival at the goal or spend extra energy; moving forward may give the robot information that it is in a dead-end because of the resulting crash. L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 101 Thus, from the POMDP perspective, optimal performance involves something akin to a “value of information” calculation, only more complex; the agent chooses between actions based on the amount of information they provide, the amount of reward they produce, and how they change the state of the world. This paper is intended to make two contributions. The first is to recapitulate work from the operations-research literature [36,42,56,59,64] and to describe its connection to closely related work in AI. The second is to describe a novel algorithmic approach for solving POMDP s exactly. We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes ( MDP s) and POMDP s. We then outline a novel algorithm for solving POMDP s off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP .We conclude with a brief discussion of related work and of approximation methods. 

2. Markov decision processes 

Markov decision processes serve as a basis for solving the more complex partially observable problems that we are ultimately interested in. An MDP is a model of an agent interacting synchronously with a world. As shown in Fig. 1, the agent takes as input the state of the world and generates as output actions, which themselves affect the state of the world. In the MDP framework, it is assumed that, although there may be a great deal of uncertainty about the effects of an agent’s actions, there is never any uncertainty about the agent’s current state—it has complete and perfect perceptual abilities. Markov decision processes are described in depth in a variety of texts [3,49]; we will just briefly cover the necessary background. 

2.1. Basic framework 

A Markov decision process can be described as a tuple 〈S, A, T , R 〉, where 

• S is a finite set of states of the world; 

• A is a finite set of actions; 

• T : S × A → Π( S) is the state-transition function , giving for each world state and agent action, a probability distribution over world states (we write T (s, a, s ′) for the probability of ending in state s′, given that the agent starts in state s and takes action a); and    

> Fig. 1. An MDP models the synchronous interaction between agent and world. 102 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134

• R : S × A → R is the reward function, giving the expected immediate reward gained by the agent for taking each action in each state (we write R(s, a) for the expected reward for taking action a in state s). In this model, the next state and the expected reward depend only on the previous state and the action taken; even if we were to condition on additional previous states, the transition probabilities and the expected rewards would remain the same. This is known as the Markov property—the state and reward at time t + 1 is dependent only on the state at time t and the action at time t.In fact, MDP s can have infinite state and action spaces. The algorithms that we describe in this section apply only to the finite case; however, in the context of POMDP s, we will consider a class of MDP s with uncountably infinite state spaces. 

2.2. Acting optimally 

We would like our agents to act in such a way as to maximize some measure of the long-run reward received. One such framework is finite-horizon optimality, in which the agent should act in order to maximize the expected sum of reward that it gets on the next k

steps; it should maximize 

E

[k−1∑

> t=0

rt

]

where rt is the reward received on step t. This model is somewhat inconvenient, because it is rare that an appropriate k will be known exactly. We might prefer to consider an infinite lifetime for the agent. The most straightforward is the infinite-horizon discounted model, in which we sum the rewards over the infinite lifetime of the agent, but discount them geometrically using discount factor 0 < γ < 1; the agent should act so as to optimize 

E

[ ∞∑

> t=0

γ t rt

]

.

In this model, rewards received earlier in its lifetime have more value to the agent; the infinite lifetime is considered, but the discount factor ensures that the sum is finite. This sum is also the expected amount of reward received if a decision to terminate the run is made on each step with probability 1 − γ . The larger the discount factor (closer to 1), the more effect future rewards have on current decision making. In our forthcoming discussions of finite-horizon optimality, we will also use a discount factor; when it has value one, it is equivalent to the simple finite-horizon case described above. A policy is a description of the behavior of an agent. We consider two kinds of policies: stationary and nonstationary. A stationary policy , π : S → A, is a situation-action mapping that specifies, for each state, an action to be taken. The choice of action depends only on the state and is independent of the time step. A nonstationary policy is a sequence of situation-action mappings, indexed by time. The policy π t is to be used to choose the action on the 

tth-to-last step as a function of the current state, st . In the finite-horizon model, the optimal policy is not typically stationary: the way an agent chooses its actions on the last step of its life is generally going to be very different from the way it chooses them when it has a long L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 103 life ahead of it. In the infinite-horizon discounted model, the agent always has a constant expected amount of time remaining, so there is no reason to change action strategies: there is a stationary optimal policy. Given a policy, we can evaluate it based on the long-run value that the agent expects to gain from executing it. In the finite-horizon case, let V π,t (s) be the expected sum of reward gained from starting in state s and executing nonstationary policy π for t steps. Clearly, 

V π, 1(s) = R(s, π 1(s)) ; that is, on the last step, the value is just the expected reward for taking the action specified by the final element of the policy. Now, we can define V π,t (s) 

inductively as 

V π,t (s) = R(s, π t (s) ) + γ ∑ 

> s′∈S

T (s, π t (s), s ′)V π,t −1

(s′).

The t-step value of being in state s and executing nonstationary policy π is the immediate reward, R(s, π t (s)) , plus the discounted expected value of the remaining t − 1 steps. To evaluate the future, we must consider all possible resulting states s′, the likelihood of their occurrence T (s, π t (s), s ′), and their (t − 1)-step value under policy π , V π,t −1(s ′). In the infinite-horizon discounted case, we write V π (s) for the expected discounted sum of future reward for starting in state s and executing policy π . It is recursively defined by 

V π (s) = R(s, π(s) ) + γ ∑ 

> s′∈S

T (s, π(s), s ′)V π

(s′).

The value function, V π , for policy π is the unique simultaneous solution of this set of linear equations, one equation for each state s.Now we know how to compute a value function, given a policy. Sometimes, we will need to go the opposite way, and compute a greedy policy given a value function. It really only makes sense to do this for the infinite-horizon discounted case; to derive a policy for the finite horizon, we would need a whole sequence of value functions. Given any value function V , a greedy policy with respect to that value function, π V , is defined as 

πV (s) = argmax 

> a

[

R(s, a) + γ ∑ 

> s′∈S

T (s, a, s ′)V (s′)]

.

This is the policy obtained by, at every step, taking the action that maximizes expected immediate reward plus the expected discounted value of the next state, as measured by V .What is the optimal finite-horizon policy, π∗? The agent’s last step is easy: it should maximize its final reward. So

In the infinite-horizon discounted case, for any initial state s, we want to execute the policy π that maximizes V π (s) . Howard [24] showed that there exists a stationary policy, 

π∗, that is optimal for every starting state. The value function for this policy, V π∗ , also written V ∗, is defined by the set of equations 

V ∗(s) = max 

> a

[

R(s, a) + γ ∑

T (s, a, s ′)V ∗(s′)]

,

which has a unique solution. An optimal policy, π∗, is just a greedy policy with respect to V ∗.Another way to understand the infinite-horizon value function, V ∗, is to approach it by using an ever-increasing discounted finite horizon. As the horizon, t, approaches infinity, 

V ∗ 

> t

approaches V ∗. This is only guaranteed to occur when the discount factor, γ , is less than 1, which tends to wash out the details of exactly what happens at the end of the agent’s life. 

2.3. Computing an optimal policy 

There are many methods for finding optimal policies for MDP s. In this section, we explore value iteration because it will also serve as the basis for finding policies in the partially observable case. 

Algorithm 1. The value-iteration algorithm for finite state space MDP s. 

V1(s) := 0 for all st := 1

t := t + 1

loop for all s ∈ S

loop for all a ∈ A

> s′∈S

T (s, a, s ′)V t−1(s ′)

end loop 

V t (s) := max a Qat (s) 

end loop until |V t (s) − V t−1(s) | < ε for all s ∈ S

Value iteration proceeds by computing the sequence V t of discounted finite-horizon optimal value functions, as shown in Algorithm 1 (the superscript ∗ is omitted, because we shall henceforth only be considering optimal value functions). It makes use of an auxiliary function, Qat (s) , which is the t-step value of starting in state s, taking action a, then continuing with the optimal (t − 1)-step nonstationary policy. The algorithm terminates when the maximum difference between two successive value functions (known as the 

Bellman error magnitude ) is less than some ε. It can be shown [62] that there exists a t∗,polynomial in |S|, |A|, the magnitude of the largest value of R(s, a) , and 1 /( 1 − γ ) , such that the greedy policy with respect to V t∗ is equal to the optimal infinite-horizon policy, π∗.Rather than calculating a bound on t∗ in advance and running value iteration for that long, L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 105 we instead use the following result regarding the Bellman error magnitude [66] in order to terminate with a near-optimal policy. If |V t (s) − V t−1(s) | < ε for all s, then the value of the greedy policy with respect to V t

does not differ from V ∗ by more than 2 εγ /( 1 − γ ) at any state. That is, max 

> s∈S

∣∣V πVt (s) − V ∗(s) ∣∣ < 2ε γ

1 − γ .

It is often the case that π V t = π∗ long before V t is near V ∗; tighter bounds may be obtained using the span semi-norm on the value function [49]. 

3. Partial observability 

For MDP s we can compute the optimal policy π and use it to act by simply executing 

π(s) for current state s. What happens if the agent is no longer able to determine the state it is currently in with complete reliability? A naive approach would be for the agent to map the most recent observation directly into an action without remembering anything from the past. In our hallway navigation example, this amounts to performing the same action in every location that looks the same—hardly a promising approach. Somewhat better results can be obtained by adding randomness to the agent’s behavior: a policy can be a mapping from observations to probability distributions over actions [55]. Randomness effectively allows the agent to sometimes choose different actions in different locations with the same appearance, increasing the probability that it might choose a good action; in practice deterministic observation-action mappings are prone to getting trapped in deterministic loops [32]. In order to behave truly effectively in a partially observable world, it is necessary to use memory of previous actions and observations to aid in the disambiguation of the states of the world. The POMDP framework provides a systematic method of doing just that. 

3.1. POMDP framework 

A partially observable Markov decision process can be described as a tuple 〈S, A, T , R, Ω, O 〉, where 

• S, A, T , and R describe a Markov decision process; 

• Ω is a finite set of observations the agent can experience of its world; and 

• O : S × A → Π(Ω) is the observation function , which gives, for each action and resulting state, a probability distribution over possible observations (we write 

O(s ′, a, o) for the probability of making observation o given that the agent took action 

a and landed in state s′). A POMDP is an MDP in which the agent is unable to observe the current state. Instead, it makes an observation based on the action and resulting state. 4 The agent’s goal remains to maximize expected discounted future reward. 4 It is possible to formulate an equivalent model in which the observation depends on the previous state instead of, or in addition to, the resulting state, but it complicates the exposition and adds no more expressive power; such a model could be converted into a POMDP model as described above, at the cost of expanding the state space. 106 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134    

> Fig. 2. A POMDP agent can be decomposed into a state estimator (SE) and a policy ( π).

3.2. Problem structure 

We decompose the problem of controlling a POMDP into two parts, as shown in Fig. 2. The agent makes observations and generates actions. It keeps an internal belief state , b, that summarizes its previous experience. The component labeled SE is the state estimator : it is responsible for updating the belief state based on the last action, the current observation, and the previous belief state. The component labeled π is the policy: as before, it is responsible for generating actions, but this time as a function of the agent’s belief state rather than the state of the world. What, exactly, is a belief state? One choice might be the most probable state of the world, given the past experience. Although this might be a plausible basis for action in some cases, it is not sufficient in general. In order to act effectively, an agent must take into account its own degree of uncertainty. If it is lost or confused, it might be appropriate for it to take sensing actions such as asking for directions, reading a map, or searching for a landmark. In the POMDP framework, such actions are not explicitly distinguished: their informational properties are described via the observation function. Our choice for belief states will be probability distributions over states of the world. These distributions encode the agent’s subjective probability about the state of the world and provide a basis for acting under uncertainty. Furthermore, they comprise a sufficient statistic for the past history and initial belief state of the agent: given the agent’s current belief state (properly computed), no additional data about its past actions or observations would supply any further information about the current state of the world [1,56]. This means that the process over belief states is Markov, and that no additional data about the past would help to increase the agent’s expected reward. To illustrate the evolution of a belief state, we will use the simple example depicted in Fig. 3; the algorithm for computing belief states is provided in the next section. There are four states in this example, one of which is a goal state, indicated by the star. There are two possible observations: one is always made when the agent is in state 1, 2, or 4; the other, when it is in the goal state. There are two possible actions: EAST and WEST . These actions succeed with probability 0 .9, and when they fail, the movement is in the opposite L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 107   

> Fig. 3. In this simple POMDP environment, the empty squares are all indistinguishable on the basis of their immediate appearance, but the evolution of the belief state can be used to model the agent’s location.

direction. If no movement is possible in a particular direction, then the agent remains in the same location. Assume that the agent is initially equally likely to be in any of the three nongoal states. Thus, its initial belief state is [ 0.333 0.333 0.000 0.333 ], where the position in the belief vector corresponds to the state number. If the agent takes action EAST and does not observe the goal, then the new belief state becomes [ 0.100 0.450 0.000 0.450 ]. If it takes action EAST again, and still does not observe the goal, then the probability mass becomes concentrated in the right-most state: 

[ 0.100 0.164 0.000 0.736 ]. Notice that as long as the agent does not observe the goal state, it will always have some nonzero belief that it is in any of the nongoal states, since the actions have nonzero probability of failing. 

3.3. Computing belief states 

A belief state b is a probability distribution over S. We let b(s) denote the probability assigned to world state s by belief state b. The axioms of probability require that 0 6

b(s) 6 1 for all s ∈ S and that ∑ 

> s∈S

b(s) = 1. The state estimator must compute a new belief state, b′, given an old belief state b, an action a, and an observation o. The new degree of belief in some state s′, b′(s ′), can be obtained from basic probability theory as follows: 

b′(s′) = Pr (s′ | o, a, b )

= Pr (o | s′, a, b ) Pr (s′ | a, b )

Pr (o | a, b )

= Pr (o | s′, a ) ∑  

> s∈S

Pr (s′ | a, b, s ) Pr (s | a, b )

Pr (o | a, b )

= O(s′, a, o ) ∑  

> s∈S

T (s, a, s ′)b(s) 

Pr (o | a, b) .

The denominator, Pr (o | a, b) , can be treated as a normalizing factor, independent of s′,that causes b′ to sum to 1. The state-estimation function SE (b, a, o) has as its output the new belief state b′.Thus, the state-estimation component of a POMDP controller can be constructed quite simply from a given model. 108 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 3.4. Finding an optimal policy 

The policy component of a POMDP agent must map the current belief state into action. Because the belief state is a sufficient statistic, the optimal policy is the solution of a continuous space “belief MDP ”. It is defined as follows: 

• B, the set of belief states, comprise the state space; 

• A, the set of actions, remains the same; 

• τ (b, a, b ′) is the state-transition function, which is defined as 

τ (b, a, b ′) = Pr (b′ | a, b ) = ∑

> o∈Ω

Pr (b′ | a, b, o )Pr (o | a, b), 

where Pr (b′ | b, a, o ) =

{ 1 if SE (b, a, o) = b′

0 otherwise; 

• ρ(b, a) is the reward function on belief states, constructed from the original reward function on world states: 

ρ(b, a) = ∑

> s∈S

b(s)R(s, a). 

The reward function may seem strange; the agent appears to be rewarded for merely believing that it is in good states. However, because the state estimator is constructed from a correct observation and transition model of the world, the belief state represents the true occupation probabilities for all states s ∈ S, and therefore the reward function ρ represents the true expected reward to the agent. This belief MDP is such that an optimal policy for it, coupled with the correct state estimator, will give rise to optimal behavior (in the discounted infinite-horizon sense) for the original POMDP [1,59]. The remaining problem, then, is to solve this MDP . It is very difficult to solve continuous space MDP s in the general case, but, as we shall see in the next section, the optimal value function for the belief MDP has special properties that can be exploited to simplify the problem. 

4. Value functions for POMDP s

As in the case of discrete MDP s, if we can compute the optimal value function, then we can use it to directly determine the optimal policy. This section concentrates on finding an approximation to the optimal value function. We approach the problem using value iteration to construct, at each iteration, the optimal t-step discounted value function over belief space. 

4.1. Policy trees 

When an agent has one step remaining, all it can do is take a single action. With two steps to go, it can take an action, make an observation, then take another action, perhaps depending on the previous observation. In general, an agent’s nonstationary t-step policy L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 109    

> Fig. 4. A t-step policy tree captures a sequence of tsteps, each of which can be conditioned on the outcome of previous actions. Each node is labeled with the action that should be taken if it is reached.

can be represented by a policy tree as shown in Fig. 4. It is a tree of depth t that specifies a complete t-step nonstationary policy. The top node determines the first action to be taken. Then, depending on the resulting observation, an arc is followed to a node on the next level, which determines the next action. This is a complete recipe for t steps of conditional behavior. 5Now, what is the expected discounted value to be gained from executing a policy tree 

p? It depends on the true state of the world when the agent starts. In the simplest case, p

is a 1-step policy tree (a single action). The value of executing that action in state s is 

V p (s) = R(s, a(p) )

where a(p) is the action specified in the top node of policy tree p. More generally, if p is a t-step policy tree, then 

V p (s) = R(s, a(p) ) + γ · (Expected value of the future )

= R(s, a(p) ) + γ ∑

O(s′, a(p), o i

)V o i (p) 

(s′)

where o i (p) is the (t − 1)-step policy subtree associated with observation o i at the top level of a t-step policy tree p. The expected value of the future is computed by first taking an expectation over possible next states, s′, then considering the value of each of those states. The value depends on which policy subtree will be executed which, itself, depends on which observation is made. So, we take another expectation, with respect to the possible observations, of the value of executing the associated subtree, o i (p) , starting in state s′.5 Policy trees are essentially equivalent to “decision trees” as used in decision theory to represent a sequential decision policy; but not to “decision trees” as used in machine learning to compactly represent a single-stage decision rule. 110 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 

Because the agent will never know the exact state of the world, it must be able to determine the value of executing a policy tree p from some belief state b. This is just an expectation over world states of executing p in each state: 

V p (b) = ∑

> s∈S

b(s)V p (s). 

It will be useful, in the following exposition, to express this more compactly. If we let 

αp = 〈 V p (s 1), . . . , V p (s n )〉, then V p (b) = b · αp .Now we have the value of executing the policy tree p in every possible belief state. To construct an optimal t-step nonstationary policy, however, it will generally be necessary to execute different policy trees from different initial belief states. Let P be the finite set of all t-step policy trees. Then 

V t (b) = max  

> p∈P

b · αp .

That is, the optimal t-step value of starting in belief state b is the value of executing the best policy tree in that belief state. This definition of the value function leads us to some important geometric insights into its form. Each policy tree p induces a value function V p that is linear in b, and 

V t is the upper surface of this collection of functions. So, V t is piecewise-linear and convex. Fig. 5 illustrates this property. Consider a world with only two states. In such a world, a belief state consists of a vector of two nonnegative numbers, 〈b(s 1), b(s 2)〉,that sum to 1. Because of this constraint, a single number is sufficient to describe the belief state. The value function associated with a policy tree p1 , V p1 , is a linear function of b(s 1) and is shown in the figure as a line. The value functions of other policy trees are similarly represented. Finally, V t is the maximum of all the V pi at each point in the belief space, giving us the upper surface, which is drawn in the figure with a bold line. When there are three world states, a belief state is determined by two values (again because of the simplex constraint , which requires the individual values to be nonnegative and sum to 1). The belief space can be seen as the triangle in two-space with vertices (0, 0),

(1, 0), and (0, 1). The value function associated with a single policy tree is a plane in three    

> Fig. 5. The optimal t-step value function is the upper surface of the value functions associated with all t-step policy trees. L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 111

space, and the optimal value function is a bowl shape that is composed of planar facets; a typical example is shown in Fig. 6, but it is possible for the “bowl” to be tipped on its side or to degenerate to a single plane. This general pattern repeats itself in higher dimensions, but becomes difficult to contemplate and even harder to draw! The convexity of the optimal value function makes intuitive sense when we think about the value of belief states. States that are in the “middle” of the belief space have high entropy—the agent is very uncertain about the real underlying state of the world. In such belief states, the agent cannot select actions very appropriately and so tends to gain less long-term reward. In low-entropy belief states, which are near the corners of the simplex, the agent can take actions more likely to be appropriate for the current state of the world and, so, gain more reward. This has some connection to the notion of “value of information,” [25] where an agent can incur a cost to move it from a high-entropy to a low-entropy state; this is only worthwhile when the value of the information (the difference in value between the two states) exceeds the cost of gaining the information. Given a piecewise-linear convex value function and the t-step policy trees from which it was derived, it is straightforward to determine the optimal situation-action mapping for execution on the tth step from the end. The optimal value function can be projected back down onto the belief space, yielding a partition into polyhedral regions. Within each region, there is some single policy tree p such that b · αp is maximal over the entire region. The optimal action for each belief state in this region is a(p) , the action in the root node of policy tree p; furthermore, the entire policy tree p can be executed from this point by conditioning the choice of further actions directly on observations, without updating the

belief state (though this is not necessarily an efficient way to represent a complex policy). Fig. 7 shows the projection of the optimal value function down into a policy partition in the two-dimensional example introduced in Fig. 5; over each of the intervals illustrated, a single policy tree can be executed to maximize expected reward. 

4.2. Value functions as sets of vectors 

It is possible, in principle, that every possible policy tree might represent the optimal strategy at some point in the belief space and, hence, that each would contribute to the computation of the optimal value function. Luckily, however, this seems rarely to be the case. There are generally many policy trees whose value functions are totally dominated by or tied with value functions associated with other policy trees. Fig. 8 shows a situation in which the value function associated with policy tree pd is completely dominated by (everywhere less than or equal to) the value function for policy tree pb. The situation with the value function for policy tree pc is somewhat more complicated; although it is not completely dominated by any single value function, it is completely dominated by pa and 

pb taken together. Given a set of policy trees, ˜V, it is possible to define a unique 6 minimal subset V that represents the same value function. We will call this a parsimonious representation of the value function, and say that a policy tree is useful if it is a component of the parsimonious representation of the value function. Given a vector, α, and a set of vectors V, we define R(α, V) to be the region of belief space over which α dominates; that is, 

R(α, V) = {b | b · α > b · ˜ α, for all ˜α ∈ V − α and b ∈ B}.

It is relatively easy, using a linear program, to find a point in R(α, V) if one exists, or to determine that the region is empty [9]. The simplest pruning strategy, proposed by Sondik [42,58], is to test R(α, ˜V) for every 

α in ˜V and remove those α that are nowhere dominant. A much more efficient pruning 6 We assume here that two policy trees with the same value function are identical. L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 113 

> Fig. 8. Some policy trees may be totally dominated by others and can be ignored.

method was proposed by Lark and White [64] and is described in detail by Littman [35] and by Cassandra [9]. Because it has many subtle technical details, it is not described here. 

4.3. One step of value iteration 

The value function for a POMDP can be computed using value iteration, with the same basic structure as for the discrete MDP case. The new problem, then, is how to compute a parsimonious representation of V t from a parsimonious representation of V t−1 .One of the simplest algorithms for solving this problem [42,58], which we call exhaustive enumeration, works by constructing a large representation of V t , then pruning it. We let V stand for a set of policy trees, though for each tree we need only actually store the top-level action and the vector of values, α. The idea behind this algorithm is the following: Vt−1 , the set of useful (t − 1)-step policy trees, can be used to construct a superset V+ 

> t

of the useful t-step policy trees. A t-step policy tree is composed of a root node with an associated action a and |Ω| subtrees, each a (t − 1)-step policy tree. We propose to restrict our choice of subtrees to those (t − 1)-step policy trees that were useful. For any belief state and any choice of policy subtree, there is always a useful subtree that is at least as good at that state; there is never any reason to include a nonuseful policy subtree. The time complexity of a single iteration of this algorithm can be divided into two parts: generation and pruning. There are |A|| Vt−1| |Ω| elements in V+ 

> t

: there are |A| different ways to choose the action and all possible lists of length |Ω| may be chosen from the set 

Vt−1 to form the subtrees. The value functions for the policy trees in V+ 

> t

can be computed efficiently from those of the subtrees. Pruning requires one linear program for each element of the starting set of policy trees and does not add to the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm. Although it keeps parsimonious representations of the value functions at each step, this algorithm still does more much work than may be necessary. Even if Vt is very small, it goes through the step of generating V+ 

> t

, which always has size exponential in |Ω|. In the next sections, we present the witness algorithm and some complexity analysis, and then briefly outline some other algorithms for this problem that attempt to be more efficient than the approach of exhaustively generating V+ 

> t

.114 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 4.4. The witness algorithm 

To improve the complexity of the value-iteration algorithm, we must avoid generating 

V+ 

> t

; instead, we would like to generate the elements of Vt directly. If we could do this, we might be able to reach a computation time per iteration that is polynomial in |S|, |A|, |Ω|,

|Vt−1|, and |Vt |. Cheng [10] and Smallwood and Sondik [56] also try to avoid generating all of V+ 

> t

by constructing Vt directly. However, their algorithms still have worst-case running times exponential in at least one of the problem parameters [34]. In fact, the existence of an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in |S|, |A|, |Ω|, |Vt−1|, and |Vt | would settle the long-standing complexity-theoretic question “Does NP = RP?” in the affirmative [34], so we will pursue a slightly different approach. Instead of computing Vt directly, we will compute, for each action a, a set Qat of t-step policy trees that have action a at their root. We can compute Vt by taking the union of the Qat sets for all actions and pruning as described in the previous section. The witness 

algorithm is a method for computing Qat in time polynomial in |S|, |A|, |Ω|, |Vt−1|, and 

|Qat | (specifically, run time is polynomial in the size of the inputs, the outputs, and an important intermediate result). It is possible that the Qat are exponentially larger than Vt ,but this seems to be rarely the case in practice. In what sense is the witness algorithm superior to previous algorithms for solving POMDP s, then? Experiments indicate that the witness algorithm is faster in practice over a wide range of problem sizes [34]. The primary complexity-theoretic difference is that the witness algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of policy trees in Qat . There are example problems that cause the other algorithms, although they never construct the Qat ’s directly, to run in time exponential in the number of policy trees in Qat . That means, if we restrict ourselves to problems in which |Qat | is polynomial, that the running time of the witness algorithm is polynomial. It is worth noting, however, that it is possible to create families of POMDP s that Cheng’s linear support algorithm (sketched in Section 4.5) can solve in polynomial time that take the witness exponential time to solve; they are problems in which S and Vt are very small and Qat is exponentially larger for some action a.From the definition of the state estimator SE and the t-step value function V t (b) , we can express Qat (b) (recall that this is the value of taking action a in belief state b and continuing optimally for t − 1 steps) formally as 

Qat (b) = ∑

> s∈S

b(s)R(s, a) + γ ∑

> o∈Ω

Pr (o | a, b)V t−1

(b′

> o

)

where b′ 

> o

is the belief state resulting from taking action a and observing o from belief state b; that is, b′ = SE (b, a, o) . Since V is the value of the best action, we have 

V t (b) = max a Qat (b) .Using arguments similar to those in Section 4.1, we can show that these Q-functions are piecewise-linear and convex and can be represented by collections of policy trees. Let 

Qat be the collection of policy trees that specify Qat . Once again, we can define a unique minimal useful set of policy trees for each Q function. Note that the policy trees needed to represent the function V t are a subset of the policy trees needed to represent all of the Qat

functions: Vt ⊆ ⋃ 

> a

Qat . This is because maximizing over actions and then policy trees is the same as maximizing over the pooled sets of policy trees. L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 115

The code in Algorithm 2 outlines our approach to solving POMDP s. The basic structure remains that of value iteration. At iteration t, the algorithm has a representation of the optimal t-step value function. Within the value-iteration loop, separate Q-functions for each action, represented by parsimonious sets of policy trees, are returned by calls to 

witness using the value function from the previous iteration. The union of these sets forms a representation of the optimal value function. Since there may be extraneous policy trees in the combined set, it is pruned to yield the useful set of t-step policy trees, Vt .

4.4.1. Witness inner loop 

The basic structure of the witness algorithm is as follows. We would like to find a minimal set of policy trees for representing Qat for each a. We consider the Q-functions one at a time. The set Ua of policy trees is initialized with a single policy tree, with action a at the root, that is the best for some arbitrary belief state (this is easy to do, as described in the following paragraph). At each iteration we ask: Is there some belief state 

b for which the true value Qat (b) , computed by one-step lookahead using Vt−1 , is different from the estimated value ̂ Qat (b) , computed using the set Ua ? We call such a belief state a witness because it can, in a sense, testify to the fact that the set Ua is not yet a perfect representation of Qat (b) . Note that for all b,̂ Qat (b) 6 Qat (b) ; the approximation is always an underestimate of the true value function. Once a witness is identified, we find the policy tree with action a at the root that will yield the best value at that belief state. To construct this tree, we must find, for each observation o, the (t − 1)-step policy tree that should be executed if observation o is made after executing action a. If this happens, the agent will be in belief state b′ = SE (b, a, o) ,from which it should execute the (t − 1)-step policy tree po ∈ Vt−1 that maximizes V po (b ′).The tree p is built with subtrees po for each observation o. We add the new policy tree to 

Ua to improve the approximation. This process continues until we can prove that no more witness points exist and therefore that the current Q-function is perfect. 

4.4.2. Identifying a witness 

To find witness points, we must be able to construct and evaluate alternative policy trees. If p is a t-step policy tree, o i an observation, and p′ a (t − 1)-step policy tree, then we define pnew as a t-step policy tree that agrees with p in its action and all its subtrees except for observation o i , for which o i (p new ) = p′. Fig. 9 illustrates the relationship between p

and pnew .116 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 

> Fig. 9. A new policy tree can be constructed by replacing one of its subtrees.

Now we can state the witness theorem [34]: The true Q-function, Qat , differs from the approximate Q-function, ̂ Qat , if and only if there is some p ∈ Ua , o ∈ Ω, and p′ ∈ Vt−1for which there is some b such that 

V pnew (b) > V ˜p (b), (1) for all ˜p ∈ Ua . That is, if there is a belief state, b, for which pnew is an improvement over all the policy trees we have found so far, then b is a witness. Conversely, if none of the trees can be improved by replacing a single subtree, there are no witness points. A proof of this theorem is included in Appendix A. 

4.4.3. Checking the witness condition 

The witness theorem requires us to search for a p ∈ Ua , an o ∈ Ω, a p′ ∈ Vt−1 and a 

b ∈ B such that condition (1) holds, or to guarantee that no such quadruple exists. Since 

Ua , Ω, and Vt−1 are finite and (we hope) small, checking all combinations will not be too time consuming. However, for each combination, we need to search all the belief states to test condition (1). This we can do using linear programming. For each combination of p, o and p′ we compute the policy tree pnew , as described above. For any belief state b and policy tree ˜p ∈ Ua , V pnew (b) − V ˜p (b) gives the advantage of following policy tree pnew instead of ˜p starting from b. We would like to find a b that maximizes the advantage over all policy trees ˜p the algorithm has found so far. The linear program in Algorithm 3 solves exactly this problem. The variable δ is the minimum amount of improvement of pnew over any policy tree in Ua at b. It has a set of constraints that restrict δ to be a bound on the difference and a set of simplex constraints that force b to be a well-formed belief state. It then seeks to maximize the advantage of 

pnew over all ˜p ∈ Ua . Since the constraints are all linear, this can be accomplished by linear programming. The total size of the linear program is one variable for each component of the belief state and one representing the advantage, plus one constraint for each policy tree in U , one constraint for each state, and one constraint to ensure that the belief state sums to one. 77 In many linear-programming packages, all variables have implicit nonnegativity constraints, so the b(s) > 0constraints are not needed. L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 117 If the linear program finds that the biggest advantage is not positive, that is, that δ 6 0, then pnew is not an improvement over all ˜p trees. Otherwise, it is and b is a witness point.

4.4.4. A single step of value iteration 

The complete value-iteration step starts with an agenda containing any single useful policy tree and with Ua empty. It takes a policy tree off the top of the agenda and uses it as pnew in the linear program of Algorithm 3 to determine whether it is an improvement over the policy trees in Ua . If a witness point is discovered, the best policy tree for that point is calculated and added to Ua and all policy trees that differ from the current policy tree in a single subtree are added to the agenda. If no witness points are discovered, then that policy tree is removed from the agenda. When the agenda is empty, the algorithm terminates. Since we know that no more than Qat witness points are discovered (each adds a tree to the set of useful policy trees), only |Vt−1|| Ω||| Qat | trees can ever be added to the agenda (in addition to the one tree in the initial agenda). Each linear program solved has |S| variables and no more than 1 + | S| + | Qat | constraints. Each of these linear programs either removes a policy tree from the agenda (this happens at most 1 + (|Vt−1| − 1)|Ω|| Qat | times) or a witness point is discovered (this happens at most |Qat | times). These facts imply that the running time of a single pass of value iteration using the witness algorithm is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the state space ( |S|), the size of the action space ( |A|), the number of policy trees in the representation of the previous iteration’s value function ( |Vt−1|), the number of observations ( |Ω|), and the number of policy trees in the representation of the current iteration’s Q-functions ( ∑ 

> a

|Qat |). Note that we must assume that the number of bits of precision used in specifying the model is polynomial in these quantities since the polynomial running time of linear programming is expressed as a function of the input precision [54]. 

4.5. Alternative approaches 

The witness algorithm is by no means the only exact algorithm for solving finite-horizon POMDP s. The first such algorithm was described by Sondik [56,58]. The one-pass 118 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 

algorithm works by identifying linear regions of the value function one at a time. For each one, it creates a set of constraints that form the border of the true region, then searches those borders to determine whether another region exists beyond the border. Although the algorithm is sophisticated and, in principle, avoids exhaustively enumerating the set of possibly useful policy trees at each iteration, it appears to run more slowly than the simpler enumeration methods in practice, at least for problems with small state spaces [10]. In the process of motivating the one-pass algorithm, Sondik [58] applies the same ideas to finding Q-functions instead of the complete value function. The resulting algorithm might be called the two-pass algorithm [9], and its form is much like the witness algorithm because it first constructs each separate Q-function, then combines the Q-functions together to create the optimal value function. Although it appears that the algorithm attracted no attention and was never implemented in over 25 years after the completion of Sondik’s dissertation, it was recently implemented and found to be faster than any of the algorithms that predated the witness algorithm [9]. As pointed out in Section 4, value functions in belief space have a natural geometric interpretation. For small state spaces, algorithms that exploit this geometry are quite efficient [16]. An excellent example of this is Cheng’s linear support algorithm [10]. This algorithm can be viewed as a variation of the witness algorithm in which witness points are sought at the corners of regions of the approximate value function defined by the algorithm’s equivalent of the set U . In two dimensions, these corners can be found easily and efficiently; the linear support algorithm can be made to run in low-order polynomial time for problems with two states. In higher dimensions, more complex algorithms are needed and the number of corners is often exponential in the dimensionality. Thus, the geometric approaches are useful only in POMDP s with extremely small state spaces. Zhang and Liu [67] describe the incremental-pruning algorithm, later generalized by Cassandra, Littman, and Zhang [7]. This algorithm is simple to implement and empirically faster than the witness algorithm, while sharing its good worst-case complexity in terms of ∑ 

> a

|Qat |. The basic algorithm works like the exhaustive enumeration algorithm described in Section 4.3, but differs in that it repeatedly prunes out nonuseful policy trees during the generation procedure. As a result, compared to exhaustive enumeration, very few nonuseful policy trees are considered and the algorithm runs extremely quickly. White and Scherer [65] propose an alternative approach in which the reward function is changed so that all of the algorithms discussed in this chapter will tend to run more efficiently. This technique has not yet been combined with the witness algorithm, and may provide some improvement. 

4.6. The infinite horizon 

In the previous section, we showed that the optimal t-step value function is always piecewise-linear and convex. This is not necessarily true for the infinite-horizon discounted value function; it remains convex [63], but may have infinitely many facets. Still, the optimal infinite-horizon discounted value function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a finite-horizon value function for a sufficiently long horizon [51,59]. The optimal infinite-horizon discounted value function can be approximated via value iteration, in which the series of t-step discounted value functions is computed; the L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 119 iteration is stopped when the difference between two successive results is small, yielding an arbitrarily good piecewise-linear and convex approximation to the desired value function. From the approximate value function we can extract a stationary policy that is approximately optimal. Sondik [59] and Hansen [23] have shown how to use algorithms like the witness algorithm that perform exact dynamic-programming backups in POMDP s in a policy-iteration algorithm to find exact solutions to many infinite-horizon problems. 

5. Understanding policies 

In this section we introduce a very simple example and use it to illustrate some properties of POMDP policies. Other examples are explored in an earlier paper [8]. 

5.1. The tiger problem 

Imagine an agent standing in front of two closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a tiger and behind the other is a large reward. If the agent opens the door with the tiger, then a large penalty is received (presumably in the form of some amount of bodily injury). Instead of opening one of the two doors, the agent can listen, in order to gain some information about the location of the tiger. Unfortunately, listening is not free; in addition, it is also not entirely accurate. There is a chance that the agent will hear a tiger behind the left-hand door when the tiger is really behind the right-hand door, and vice versa. We refer to the state of the world when the tiger is on the left as sl and when it is on the right as sr . The actions are LEFT , RIGHT , and LISTEN . The reward for opening the correct door is +10 and the penalty for choosing the door with the tiger behind it is −100. The cost of listening is −1. There are only two possible observations: to hear the tiger on the left ( TL ) or to hear the tiger on the right ( TR ). Immediately after the agent opens a door and receives a reward or penalty, the problem resets, randomly relocating the tiger behind one of the two doors. The transition and observation models can be described in detail as follows. The LISTEN action does not change the state of the world. The LEFT and RIGHT actions cause a transition to world state sl with probability 0.5 and to state sr with probability 0.5 (essentially resetting the problem). When the world is in state sl , the LISTEN action results in observation TL with probability 0.85 and the observation TR with probability 0.15; conversely for world state sr . No matter what state the world is in, the LEFT and RIGHT actions result in either observation with probability 0.5. 

5.2. Finite-horizon policies 

The optimal undiscounted finite-horizon policies for the tiger problem are rather striking in the richness of their structure. Let us begin with the situation-action mapping for the time step t = 1, when the agent only gets to make a single decision. If the agent believes with high probability that the tiger is on the left, then the best action is to open the right door; if it believes that the tiger is on the right, the best action is to open the left door. 120 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134      

> Fig. 10. The optimal situation-action mapping for t=1 for the tiger problem shows that each of the three actions is optimal for some belief state.

But what if the agent is highly uncertain about the tiger’s location? The best thing to do is listen. Guessing incorrectly will incur a penalty of −100, whereas guessing correctly will yield a reward of +10. When the agent’s belief has no bias either way, it will guess wrong as often as it guesses right, so its expected reward for opening a door will be 

(−100 + 10 )/ 2 = − 45. Listening always has value −1, which is greater than the value of opening a door at random. Fig. 10 shows the optimal 1-step nonstationary policy. Each of the policy trees is shown as a node; below each node is the belief interval 8 over which the policy tree dominates; inside each node is the action at the root of the policy tree. We now move to the case in which the agent can act for two time steps. The optimal 2-step nonstationary policy begins with the situation-action mapping for t = 2 shown in Fig. 11. This situation-action mapping has a surprising property: it never chooses to act, only to listen. Why? Because if the agent were to open one of the doors at t = 2, then, on the next step, the tiger would be randomly placed behind one of the doors and the agent’s belief state would be reset to (0.5, 0.5). So after opening a door, the agent would be left with no information about the tiger’s location and with one action remaining. We just saw that with one step to go and b = (0.5, 0.5) the best thing to do is listen. Therefore, if the agent opens a door when t = 2, it will listen on the last step. It is a better strategy to listen when t = 2 in order to make a more informed decision on the last step. Another interesting property of the 2-step nonstationary policy is that there are multiple policy trees with the same action at the root. This implies that the value function is not linear, but is made up of five linear regions. The belief states within a single region are similar in that when they are transformed, via SE (b, a, o) , the resulting belief states will all lie in the same belief region defined by the situation-action mapping for t = 1. In other words, every single belief state in a particular region r of the situation-action mapping for 

t = 2, will, for the same action and observation, be transformed to a belief state that lies in some region r′ of the situation-action mapping for t = 1. This relationship is shown in Fig. 12. The optimal nonstationary policy for t = 3 also consists solely of policy trees with the listen action at their roots. If the agent starts from the uniform belief state, b = (0.5, 0.5),listening once does not change the belief state enough to make the expected value of opening a door greater than that of listening. The argument for this parallels that for the 

t = 2 case. 8 The belief interval is specified in terms of b(s l ) only since b(s r ) = 1 − b(s l ).L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 121               

> Fig. 11. The optimal situation-action mapping for t=2 in the tiger problem consists only of the LISTEN action.
> Fig. 12. The optimal nonstationary policy for t=2 illustrates belief state transformations from t=2 to t=1. It consists of five separate policy trees.

This argument for listening in the first steps no longer applies after t = 3; the optimal situation-action mappings for t > 3 all choose to open a door for some belief states. Fig. 13 shows the structure that emerges in the optimal nonstationary policy for t = 4. Notice that for t = 3 there are two nodes that do not have any incoming arcs from t = 4. This happens because there is no belief state at t = 4 for which the optimal action and any resulting observation generates a new belief state that lies in either of the regions defined by the unused nodes at t = 3. This graph can also be interpreted as a compact representation of all of the useful policy trees at every level. The forest of policy trees is transformed into a directed acyclic graph by collapsing all of the nodes that stand for the same policy tree into one. 

5.3. Infinite-horizon policies 

When we include a discount factor to decrease the value of future rewards, the structure of the finite-horizon POMDP value function changes slightly. As the horizon t increases, the rewards received for the final few steps have decreasing influence on the situation-action mappings for earlier time steps and the value function begins to converge. In many discounted POMDP problems, the optimal situation-action mapping for large t looks much the same as the optimal situation-action mapping for t − 1. Fig. 14 shows a portion of the optimal nonstationary policy for the discounted finite-horizon version of the tiger problem for large values of t. Notice that the structure of the graph is exactly the same from one time to the next. The vectors for each of the nodes, which together define the value function, differ only after the fifteenth decimal place. This structure first appears at time step t = 56 and remains constant through t = 105. When t = 105, the precision of the algorithm used to calculate the situation-action mappings can no longer discern any difference between the 122 L.P.

vectors’ values for succeeding intervals. At this point, we have an approximately optimal value function for the infinite-horizon discounted problem. This POMDP has the property that the optimal infinite-horizon value function has a finite number of linear segments. An associated optimal policy has a finite description and is called finitely transient [9,51,58]. P OMDP s with finitely transient optimal policies can sometimes be solved in finite time using value iteration. In POMDP s with optimal policies that are not finitely transient, the infinite-horizon value function has an infinite number of segments; on these problems the sets Vt grow with each iteration. The best we can hope L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 123 for is to solve these POMDP s approximately. It is not known whether there is a way of using the value-iteration approach described in this paper for solving all POMDP s with finitely transient optimal policies in finite time; we conjecture that there is. The only finite-time algorithm that has been described for solving POMDP s with finitely transient optimal policies over the infinite horizon is a version of policy iteration described by Sondik [58]. The simpler policy-iteration algorithm due to Hansen [23] has not been proven to converge for all such POMDP s. 9

5.4. Plan graphs 

One drawback of the POMDP approach is that the agent must maintain a belief state and use it to select an optimal action on every step; if the underlying state space or V

is large, then this computation can be expensive. In many cases, it is possible to encode the policy in a graph that can be used to select actions without any explicit representation of the belief state [59]; we refer to such graphs as plan graphs . Recall Fig. 14, in which the algorithm has nearly converged upon an infinite-horizon policy for the tiger problem. Because the situation-action mappings at every level have the same structure, we can make the nonstationary policy into a stationary one by redrawing the edges from one level to itself as if it were the succeeding level. This rearrangement of edges is shown in Fig. 15, and the result is redrawn in Fig. 16 as a plan graph. Some of the nodes of the graph will never be visited once either door is opened and the belief state is reset to (0.5, 0.5). If the agent always starts in a state of complete uncertainty, then it will never be in a belief state that lies in the region of these nonreachable nodes. This results in a simpler version of the plan graph, shown in Fig. 17. The plan graph has a simple interpretation: keep listening until you have heard the tiger twice more on one side than the other. Because the nodes represent a partition of the belief space and because all belief states within a particular region will map to a single node on the next level, the plan graph representation does not require the agent to maintain an on-line representation of the belief state; the current node is a sufficient representation of the current belief. In order to execute a plan graph, the initial belief state is used to choose a starting node. After that, the agent need only maintain a pointer to a current node in the graph. On every step, it takes the action specified by the current node, receives an observation, then follows the arc associated with that observation to a new node. This process continues indefinitely. A plan graph is essentially a finite-state controller. It uses the minimal possible amount of memory to act optimally in a partially observable environment. It is a surprising and pleasing result that it is possible to start with a discrete problem, reformulate it in terms of a continuous belief space, then map the continuous solution back into a discrete 9 As a technical aside, if there are POMDP s that have finitely transient optimal policies for which neither value iteration nor Hansen’s policy-iteration algorithm converges, the tiger problem is a good candidate. This is because the behavior of these algorithms on this problem appears to be extremely sensitive to the numerical precision used in comparisons—the better the precision, the longer the algorithms take to converge. In fact, it may be the case that imprecision is necessary for the algorithms to converge on this problem, although it is difficult to test this without detailed formal analysis. Sondik’s proof that his policy-iteration algorithm converges depends on controlled use of imprecision and we have not studied how that could best be used in the context of value iteration. 124 L.P.

controller. Furthermore, the extraction of the controller can be done automatically from two successive equal value functions. It is also important to note that there is no known a priori bound on the size of the optimal plan graph in terms of the size of the problem. In the tiger problem, for instance, if the probability of getting correct information from the LISTEN action is reduced from 0.85 to 0.65, then the optimal plan graph, shown in Fig. 18, is much larger, because the agent must hear the tiger on one side 5 times more than in the other before being sufficiently confident to act. As the observation reliability decreases, an increasing amount of memory is required. 

6. Related work 

In this section, we examine how the assumptions of the POMDP model relate to earlier work on planning in AI. We consider only models with finite-state and action spaces and static underlying dynamics, as these assumptions are consistent with the majority of work in this area. Our comparison focuses on issues of imperfect knowledge, uncertainty in initial state, the transition model, the observation model, the objective of planning, the representation of domains, and plan structures. The most closely related work to our own is that of Kushmerick, Hanks, and Weld [30] on the B URIDAN system, and Draper, Hanks and Weld [14] on the C-B URIDAN system. 

6.1. Imperfect knowledge 

Plans generated using standard MDP algorithms and classical planning algorithms 10 assume that the underlying state of the process will be known with certainty during plan execution. In the MDP framework, the agent is informed of the current state each time it takes an action. In many classical planners (e.g., SNLP [39], UCPOP [45]), the current state 10 By “classical planning” we mean linear or partial-order planners using STRIPS-like operators. 126 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 

can be calculated trivially from the known initial state and knowledge of the deterministic operators. The assumption of perfect knowledge is not valid in many domains. Research on epistemic logic [43,44,52] relaxes this assumption by making it possible to reason about what is and is not known at a given time. Unfortunately, epistemic logics have not been used as a representation in automatic planning systems, perhaps because the richness of representation they provide makes efficient reasoning very difficult. A step towards building a working planning system that reasons about knowledge is to relax the generality of the logic-based schemes. The approach of CNLP [46] uses three-valued propositions where, in addition to true and false, there is a value unknown , which represents the state when the truth of the proposition is not known. Operators can then refer to whether propositions have an unknown value in their preconditions and can have the value in their effects. This representation for imperfect knowledge is only appropriate when the designer of the system knows, in advance, what aspects of the state will be known and unknown. It is insufficient for multiple agents reasoning about each others’ knowledge and for representing certain types of correlated uncertainty [20]. Formulating knowledge as predicate values that are either known or unknown makes it impossible to reason about gradations of knowledge. For example, an agent that is fairly certain that it knows the combination to a lock might be willing to try to unlock it before seeking out more precise knowledge. Reasoning about levels of knowledge is quite common and natural in the POMDP framework. As long as an agent’s state of knowledge can be expressed as a probability distribution over possible states of the world, the POMDP perspective applies. 

6.2. Initial state 

Many classical planning systems ( SNLP , UCPOP , CNLP ) require the starting state to be known during the planning phase. An exception is the U-P LAN [38] system, which creates a separate plan for each possible initial state with the aim of making these plans easy to merge to form a single plan. Conditional planners typically have some aspects of the initial state unknown. If these aspects are important to the planning process, they are tested during execution. In the POMDP framework, the starting state is not required to be known precisely and can instead be represented as a probability distribution over possible states. B URIDAN and C-B URIDAN also use probability distributions over states as an internal representation of uncertainty, so they can deal with initial-state uncertainty in much the same way. 

6.3. Transition model 

In classical planning systems, operators have deterministic effects. The plans constructed are brittle, since they apply to a specific starting state and require the trajectory through the states to go exactly as expected. Many domains are not easily modeled with deterministic actions, since an action can have different results, even when applied in exactly the same state. L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 127 Extensions to classical planning, such as CNLP [46] and C ASSANDRA [48] have consid-ered operators with nondeterministic effects. For each operator, there is a set of possible next states that could occur. A drawback of this approach is that it gives no information about the relative likelihood of the possible outcomes. These systems plan for every possi-ble contingency to ensure that the resulting plan is guaranteed to lead to a goal state. Another approach used in modeling nondeterministic actions is to define a probability distribution over the possible next states. This makes it possible to reason about which of the resulting states are more likely and makes it possible to assess whether a plan is likely to reach the goal even if it is not guaranteed to do so. This type of action model is used in MDP sand POMDP s as well as in B URIDAN and C-B URIDAN . Other work [5,15,19] has used representations that can be used to compute probability distributions over future states. 

6.4. Observation model 

When the starting state is known and actions are deterministic, there is no need to get feedback from the environment when executing a plan. However, if the starting state is unknown or the actions have nondeterministic effects, more effective plans can be built by exploiting feedback, or observations, from the environment concerning the identity of the current state. If observations reveal the precise identity of the current state, the planning model is called “completely observable.” The MDP model, as well as some planning systems such as CNLP and P LINTH [18,19] assume complete observability. Other systems, such as B URIDAN and MAXPLAN [37], have no observation model and can attack “completely unobservable” problems. Classical planning systems typically have no observation model, but the fact that the initial state is known and operators are deterministic means that they can also be thought of as solving completely observable problems. Completely observable and completely unobservable models are particularly clean but are unrealistic. The POMDP and C-B URIDAN frameworks model partially observable environments, in that observations provide some information about the underlying state, but not enough to guarantee that it will be known with certainty. This model provides for a great deal of expressiveness (both completely observable and completely unobservable models can be viewed as special cases), but is quite difficult to solve. It is an interesting and powerful model because it allows systems to reason about taking actions to gather knowledge that will be important for later decision making. 

6.5. Objective 

The job of a planner is to find a plan that satisfies a particular objective; most often, the objective is a goal of achievement, that is, to arrive at some state that is in a set of problem-specific goal states. When probabilistic information is available concerning the initial state and transitions, a more general objective can be used—reaching a goal state with sufficient probability (see, for example, work on B URIDAN and C-B URIDAN ). A popular alternative to goal attainment is maximizing total expected discounted reward (total-reward criterion). Under this objective, each action results in an immediate reward that is a function of the current state. The exponentially discounted sum of these rewards 128 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 

over the execution of a plan (finite or infinite horizon) constitutes the value of the plan. This objective is used extensively in most work with MDP s and POMDP s, including ours. Several authors (for example, Koenig [27]) have pointed out that, given a completely observable problem stated as one of goal achievement, reward functions can be constructed so that a policy that maximizes reward can be used to maximize the probability of goal attainment in the original problem. This shows that the total-reward criterion is no less general than goal achievement in completely observable domains. The same holds for finite-horizon partially observable domains. Interestingly, a more complicated transformation holds in the opposite direction: any total expected discounted reward problem (completely observable or finite horizon) can be transformed into a goal-achievement problem of similar size [12,69]. Roughly, the transformation simulates the discount factor by introducing an absorbing state with a small probability of being entered on each step. Rewards are then simulated by normalizing all reward values to be between zero and one and then “siphoning off” some of the probability of absorption equal to the amount of normalized reward. The (perhaps counterintuitive) conclusion is that goal-attainment problems and reward-type problems are computationally equivalent. There is a qualitative difference in the kinds of problems typically addressed with POMDP models and those addressed with planning models. Quite frequently, POMDP s are used to model situations in which the agent is expected to go on behaving indefinitely, rather than simply until a goal is achieved. Given the inter-representability results between goal-probability problems and discounted-optimality problems, it is hard to make technical sense of this difference. In fact, many POMDP models should probably be addressed in an average-reward context [17]. Using a discounted-optimal policy in a truly infinite-duration setting is a convenient approximation, similar to the use of a situation-action mapping from a finite-horizon policy in receding horizon control. Littman [35] catalogs some alternatives to the total-reward criterion, all of which are based on the idea that the objective value for a plan is based on a summary of immediate rewards over the duration of a run. Koenig and Simmons [28] examine risk-sensitive planning and showed how planners for the total-reward criterion could be used to optimize risk-sensitive behavior. Haddawy et al. [21] looked at a broad family of decision-theoretic objectives that make it possible to specify trade-offs between partially satisfying goals quickly and satisfying them completely. Bacchus, Boutilier and Grove [2] show how some richer objectives based on evaluations of sequences of actions can actually be converted to total-reward problems. Other objectives considered in planning systems, aside from simple goals of achievement, include goals of maintenance and goals of prevention [15]; these types of goals can typically be represented using immediate rewards as well. 

6.6. Representation of problems 

The propositional representations most often used in planning have a number of advantages over the flat state-space representations associated with MDP s and POMDP s. The main advantage comes from their compactness—just as with operator schemata, which can represent many individual actions in a single operator, propositional representations can be exponentially more concise than a fully expanded state-based transition matrix for an MDP .L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 129 Algorithms for manipulating compact (or factored) POMDP s have begun to ap-pear [6,14]—this is a promising area for future research. At present, however, there is no evidence that these algorithms result in improved planning time significantly over the use of a “flat” representation of the state space. 

6.7. Plan structures 

Planning systems differ in the structure of the plans they produce. It is important that a planner be able to express the optimal plan if one exists for a given domain. We briefly review some popular plan structures along with domains in which they are sufficient for expressing optimal behavior. Traditional plans are simple sequences of actions. They are sufficient when the initial state is known and all actions are deterministic. A slightly more elaborate structure is the partially ordered plan (generated, for example, by SNLP and UCPOP ), or the parallel plan [4]. In this type of plan, actions can be left unordered if all orderings are equivalent under the performance metric. When actions are stochastic, partially ordered plans can still be used (as in B URIDAN ), but contingent plans can be more effective. The simplest kind of contingent or branching plan is one that has a tree structure (as generated by CNLP or P LINTH ). In such a plan, some of the actions have different possible outcomes that can be observed, and the flow of execution of the plan is conditioned on the outcome. Branching plans are sufficient for representing optimal plans for finite-horizon domains. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can represent the same class of plans, but potentially do so much more succinctly, because separate branches can share structure. C-B URIDAN uses a representation of contingent plans that also allows for structure sharing (although of a different type than our DAG-structured plans). Our work on POMDP s finds DAG-structured plans for finite-horizon problems. For infinite-horizon problems, it is necessary to introduce loops into the plan represen-tation [31,57]. (Loops might also be useful in long finite-horizon POMDP s for representa-tional succinctness.) A simple loop-based plan representation depicts a plan as a labeled directed graph. Each node of the graph is labeled with an action and there is one labeled outgoing edge for each possible outcome of the action. It is possible to generate this type of plan graph for some POMDP s [8,22,23,47,59]. For completely observable problems with a high branching factor, a more convenient representation is a policy , which maps the current state (situation) to a choice of action. Because there is an action choice specified for all possible initial states, policies are also called universal plans [53]. This representation is not appropriate for POMDP s, since the underlying state is not fully observable. However, POMDP policies can be viewed as universal plans over belief space. It is interesting to note that there are infinite-horizon POMDP s for which no finite-state plan is sufficient. Simple 2-state examples can be constructed for which optimal behavior requires counting (i.e., a simple stack machine); there is reason to believe that general pushdown automata and perhaps even Turing machines are necessary to represent optimal plans in general. This argues that, in the limit, a plan is actually a program. Several techniques have been proposed recently for searching for good program-like controllers 130 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 

in POMDP s [29,68]. We restrict our attention to the simpler finite-horizon case and a small set of infinite-horizon problems that have optimal finite-state plans. 

7. Extensions and conclusions 

The POMDP model provides a firm foundation for work on planning under uncertainty in action and observation. It gives a uniform treatment of action to gain information and action to change the world. Although they are derived through the domain of continuous belief spaces, elegant finite-state controllers may sometimes be constructed using algorithms such as the witness algorithm. However, experimental results [34] suggest that even the witness algorithm becomes impractical for problems of modest size ( |S| > 15 and |Ω| > 15). Our current work explores the use of function-approximation methods for representing value functions and the use of simulation in order to concentrate the approximations on the frequently visited parts of the belief space [33]. The results of this work are encouraging and have allowed us to get a very good solution to an 89-state, 16-observation instance of a hallway navigation problem similar to the one described in the introduction. We are optimistic and hope to extend these techniques (and others) to get good solutions to large problems. Another area that is not addressed in this paper is the acquisition of a world model. One approach is to extend techniques for learning hidden Markov models [50,60] to learn POMDP models. Then, we could apply algorithms of the type described in this paper to the learned models. Another approach is to combine the learning of the model with the computation of the policy. This approach has the potential significant advantage of being able to learn a model that is complex enough to support optimal (or good) behavior without making irrelevant distinctions; this idea has been pursued by Chrisman [11] and McCallum [40,41]. 

Appendix A Theorem A.1. Let Ua be a nonempty set of useful policy trees, and Qat be the complete set of useful policy trees. Then Ua 6 = Qat if and only if there is some tree p ∈ Ua , observation 

o∗ ∈ Ω, and subtree p′ ∈ Vt−1 for which there is some belief state b such that 

V pnew (b) > V ˜p (b) (A.1) 

for all ˜p ∈ Ua , where pnew is a t-step policy tree that agrees with p in its action and all its subtrees except for observation o∗, for which o∗(p new ) = p′.Note that we are defining two trees to be equal if they have the same value function ; this makes it unnecessary to deal with the effect of ties in the set Ua .

Proof. The “if” direction is easy since the b can be used to identify a policy tree missing from Ua .The “only if” direction can be rephrased as: If Ua 6 = Qat then there is a belief state b, a 

p ∈ Ua , and a pnew such that pnew has a larger value than any other ˜p ∈ Ua at b.L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 131 Start by picking some p∗ ∈ Qat − Ua and choose any b such that p∗ has the highest value at b (there must be such a b since p∗ is useful). Let 

p = argmax   

> p′∈Ua

V p′ (b). 

Now, p∗ is the policy tree in Qat − Ua that has the highest value at b, and p is the policy tree in Ua that has the highest value at b. By construction, V p∗ (b) > V p (b) .Now, if p and p∗ differ in only one subtree, then we are done, p∗ can serve as a pnew in the theorem. If p and p∗ differ in more than one subtree, we will identify another policy tree that can act as pnew . Choose an observation o∗ ∈ Ω such that

There must be a o∗ satisfying this inequality since otherwise we get the contradiction
