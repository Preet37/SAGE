Abstract      

> Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models with Evol-Instruct has achieved encouraging results across a wide range of tasks. How-ever, designing effective evolving methods for instruction evolution requires substantial hu-man expertise. This paper proposes Auto Evol-Instruct , an end-to-end framework that evolves instruction datasets using large language mod-els without any human effort. The frame-work automatically analyzes and summarizes suitable evolutionary strategies for the given instruction data and iteratively improves the evolving method based on issues exposed dur-ing the instruction evolution process. Our ex-tensive experiments demonstrate that the best method optimized by Auto Evol-Instruct out-performs human-designed methods on various benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval, GSM8K, and HumanEval.

1 Introduction 

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to fol-low detailed instructions is vital to unlocking their power (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b). High-quality datasets, such as ShareGPT (Chiang et al., 2023), OpenAssistant (Köpf et al., 2023), LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), have greatly improved the performance of instruction-tuning, promoting the prosperity of LLM alignment. However, an-notating instruction following datasets with such quality is hard to scale, and its quality upper limit is also uncontrollable. Researchers (Xu et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b) are actively explor-ing ways to break through the quality upper-bound of existing datasets. Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023) takes the high-quality data as a starting point, and further iteratively refines it using LLMs, improving its complexity and diversity. It has demonstrated superior performance across a broad range of pub-lic benchmarks that evaluate diverse capabilities, including instruction following (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), code generation (Luo et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2021), and mathematical reasoning (Luo et al., 2023a; Cobbe et al., 2021). While Evol-Instruct exhibits outstanding per-formance, its heavy reliance on heuristic efforts presents notable challenges. Whenever it is used for a completely new task, the methods for exe-cution evolution need to be redesigned. Such a process requires a high level of expertise and con-siderable costs, hindering its adaptation to a wider spectrum of capabilities. To address these chal-lenges, it needs to automate the Evol-Instruct pro-cess, which will encounter the following difficul-ties: (1) Design evolving methods automatically that make the instructions more complex for a given task (2) To keep the instruction evolution process working properly, the evolving method needs to avoid evolution failure. In this paper, we propose Auto Evol-Instruct , an effective approach to utilizing LLMs in designing methods for executing instruction evolution. Auto Evol-Instruct automatically designs evolving meth-ods that make given instruction data more complex, enabling almost cost-free adaptation to different tasks by only changing the input data of the frame-work. Firstly, to transition from manually-designed evolving rules to automated ones, we begin with a universal initial evolving method. Our initial evolv-ing method is different from the method of Evol Instruct, which requires human experts to specify the rules of evolution. Instead, it can autonomously analyze the input instruction and brainstorm evolu-tion rules suitable for given data. Due to the diver-sity and complexity of varied instruction datasets, a fixed evolving method can not guarantee the sta-bility and effectiveness of all data evolution. There-fore, we leverage LLM as the optimizer to optimize the initial evolving method iteratively to ensure the lowest failure rate for a given instruction dataset. We refer to the model used for evolution as the evol LLM, and the model used for optimization as the

optimizer LLM. This optimization process involves two critical stages: (1) Evol Trajectory Analysis: The optimizer LLM carefully analyzes the poten-tial issues and failures exposed in instruction evolu-tion performed by evol LLM, generating feedback for subsequent optimization. (2) Evolving Method Optimization: The optimizer LLM optimizes the evolving method by addressing these identified is-sues in feedback. These stages alternate and re-peat to progressively develop an effective evolving method using only a subset of the instruction data. Once the optimal evolving method is identified, it directs the evol LLM to convert the entire instruc-tion dataset into more diverse and complex forms, thus facilitating improved instruction tuning. Our experiments show that the evolving meth-ods designed by Auto Evol-Instruct outperform the Evol-Instruct methods (Xu et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023a,b) designed by human experts in instruction tuning across various capabilities, in-cluding instruction following, mathematical rea-soning, and code generation. Using only 10K evolved ShareGPT for fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024), we achieve 8.09 on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) and 91.4 on AlpacaE-val (Li et al., 2023), surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo and WizardLM-70B, and comparable with Claude-2.0. Using only 7K evolved GSM8K training data for fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B, we achieve 82.49 on GSM8K, surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo, WizardMath-70B and MetaMath-70B (Yu et al., 2023). Using 20K evolved Code Alpaca to fine-tune DeepSeek-Coder-Base-33B (Guo et al., 2024), we achieve 77.4 on HumanEval, surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo and WizardCoder-34B. 

2 Background 

2.1 Evol-Instruct 

Instruction evolution (Xu et al., 2023) involves re-fining an instruction dataset to boost its complex-ity and diversity, enhancing instruction tuning ef-fectiveness. This method uses a human-designed evolving method, denoted as e, to transform orig-inal instruction dataset X = {x1, x 2, · · · , x n},where each xi is an instruction-response pair, into an improved dataset Xe. The aim is for Xe to yield superior performance Q(Xe) in a specific capabil-ity after instruction tuning, compared to the original dataset’s performance Q(X). Essentially, by evolv-ing the instruction dataset and subsequently tuning a model on Xe, the model should perform better on the targeted capability than it would using the original dataset. 

2.2 Problem Formulation 

While Evol-Instruct shows excellent performance across many areas, its dependence on high ex-pertise and limited scope restrict its broader use. Our research aims to develop an automated frame-work that identifies the optimal instruction evolving method, e∗, which maximizes performance after instruction tuning: 

e∗ = arg max 

> e

Q(Xe). (1) 6999 This framework seeks to find the evolving method 

e∗ that delivers the highest performance Q(Xe)

after tuning a model on the evolved dataset Xe.By automating this process, we aim to reduce the need for extensive human expertise and expand the application of instruction evolution. 

3 Auto Evol-Instruct 

Unlike Evol-Instruct, Auto Evol-Instruct is a fully automated framework that improves the complexity and quality of instruction data without any human intervention. Its key advancements include: (1) automatically designing evolving methods for in-struction evolution, facilitating adaptation to a wide range of tasks and enhancing model capabilities across a broader spectrum; (2) developing evolv-ing methods that surpass those crafted by human experts, while minimizing failures and ensuring successful execution of instruction evolution. Figure 1 illustrates the process of automating the design of evolving methods in the Auto Evol-Instruct Framework (Section 3.1-3.3). We also de-tail specific examples of how the evolving method changes at each step in the Table 12. This frame-work begins with a carefully designed universal evolving method and a seed instruction dataset 

X (Section 3.1). It then iteratively optimizes this initial evolving method, e0, to obtain the optimal evolving method, e∗ 1. In each optimization step t,we randomly sample a mini batch from X and uti-lize the evol LLM to evolve each instruction in the batch l times. Then the optimizer LLM analyzes the evolutionary trajectory of all instructions in the current batch to identify existing issues and gen-erate feedback (Section 3.2). As shown in Figure 1, the optimizer LLM identifies problems such as “Unimproved Complexity”. The optimizer LLM will make corresponding optimizations to evolving method et−1 to obtain et based on the feedback. Specifically, the feedback “Unimproved Complex-ity” will prompt the optimizer LLM to add a con-straint “Ensure the Complexity increase” in et. To improve the stability, we execute “analysis opti-mization” multiple times with sampling decoding in parallel to obtain m optimized evolving meth-ods. Then, we select the method with the lowest evolution failure rate as the final et. The optimiza-tion process terminates when the failure rate of 

> 1This process uses a subset of the full instruction data, randomly sampling approximately 2,000 entries, to minimize costs associated with developing the evolving method.

instruction evolution no longer decreases, or a max-imum number of optimization steps has reached (Section 3.3). Once the optimal evolving method is identified, it will be applied to guide the instruc-tion evolution across the entire instruction dataset, resulting in an evolved dataset (Section 3.4). 

3.1 Initial Evolving Method Design 

The reason why Evol-Instruct is not universally applicable is that the methods for complicating instructions vary across different domains. For in-stance, in the coding domain, methods to increase the complexity of instructions such as "propose higher time or space complexity requirements" (Luo et al., 2023b) are meaningful, but they are not quite suitable in the chat domain. The meth-ods for complicating instructions in Evol-Instruct need to be designed and summarized by human experts. The core difference in our initial evolving method design lies in that we delegate the process of designing and summarizing evolving rules to the LLMs for automation. As shown in the Figure 2, firstly we ask the evol LLM to "read the instruction carefully and list all the possible methods to make this instruction more complex". Subsequently, the evol LLM is tasked with devising a comprehensive plan based on the listed methods, and implements the plan to generate the evolved instruction. Lastly, the evol LLM conducts a thorough review of the evolved instruction, rectifying any unreasonable parts, and delivers the final evolved instruction. 

3.2 Evol Trajectory Analysis 

We primarily utilize the optimizer LLM to identify issues emerging during the instruction evolution process and offer subsequent feedback for the opti-mization of evolving method. (Examples of issues are given in the Appendix B) Specifically, at op-timization step t, the evolving method et−1 steers the evol LLM to perform l rounds of evolution on a batch of data Xt, culminating in the evolu-tionary trajectory, St = {Xt, X (1)  

> t

, · · · , X (l) 

> t

}. In this trajectory, X(i) 

> t

denotes the instruction evolved from X(i−1)  

> t

using et−1. Following this, the opti-mizer LLM scrutinizes the evolutionary trajectory to pinpoint and provide feedback ft on any issues detected. (Prompt used is detailed in Figure 7) 

3.3 Evolving Method Optimization

from the evol trajectory analysis, in accordance with the overall instruction evolution requirements. In essence, during the step t, the optimizer LLM refines the evolving method et−1, by leveraging the feedback ft. This meticulous optimization yields an updated version of the evolving method 

et. (Prompt in Optimization detailed in Figure 8). 

Multiple Optimizations In the Evol Trajectory Analysis and Method Optimization Process, the op-timizer LLM sometimes struggles to consistently provide constructive feedback and enhance the evolving method. To bolster the stability of the 

Auto Evol-Instruct framework and draw inspiration from the self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022), we implement a strategy where, at each step, the opti-mizer LLM conducts m times of analysis and opti-mization with sampling decoding. This generates 

m different potential improved evolving methods, namely e1

t to emt in Figure 1, allowing the model to explore more possibilities simultaneously (Yang et al., 2023). Specifically, we divide the instruction data into training data X and a development set D.We use the obtained potential methods to evolve instructions in D and generate corresponding re-sponse sets, denoted as Re1 

> t

to Remt . For a given 

eit, we calculate its evolution failure rate based on corresponding response set Reit :

λReit

=

∑

r∈Reit

F (r)

|D| (2) Here, |D| represents the size of the development set. F(r) is a function that determines whether in-struction evolution has failed, returning 1 for fail-ure and 0 for success. We have designed a series of rules to determine whether evolution has failed based on the reaction of evol LLM when generating answers for evolved instructions. For example, if the answer contains “understood” or “Thank you” and ends with a question mark, it indicates that the evolved instruction has not become more complex but is responding to the instruction being evolved (please refer to Appendix A for detailed judgment rules). Finally, the evolving method demonstrating the lowest evolution failure rate is selected as the subsequent step’s evolving method et.

3.4 Instruction Tuning on Evolved Data 

The Auto Evol-Instruct leads us to derive the op-timal evolving method e∗. This method is then employed to guide the evol LLM, which substan-tially improving the complexity and diversity of the entire instruction dataset. As a result, we acquire an evolved dataset. Subsequently, this enriched dataset is used to fine-tune the base LLM, thereby broadening the model’s range of capabilities. 7001 4 Experiment 

In this section, we conduct a detailed study on the effects of Auto Evol-Instruct . We begin with an overview of the experimental setup, then test our method’s effectiveness in instruction follow-ing, math reasoning, and code generation. We also present Auto Evol-Instruct’s performance results on the Open LLM Leaderboard in the Appendix D. 

4.1 Experimental Setup 

Table 1 illustrates the experimental setup, including the seed datasets, pre-training base models of vary-ing sizes (small and large) for instruction tuning, and the configuration of evol LLM and optimizer LLM. Refer to Appendix F for more details, and for details of the Baseline, refer to Appendix G. 

4.2 Evaluation Results Instruction Following We evaluate the instruction-following using MT-Bench and AlpacaEval. MT-Bench tests the model across various domains through multi-turn dialogues, while AlpacaEval au-tomates assessment based on AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023). Table 2 shows that our method sub-stantially improves performance across different model scales. For smaller models, our method improves by approximately 0.63 on MT-Bench compared to seed data. For larger models, there’s still a performance boost of 0.44. Despite using only 10K data for fine-tuning on Mixtral-8x7B, our method matches or surpasses the performance of open-source models that utilize more data and train on larger models, achieving results comparable to Tulu-v2-dpo on MT-Bench and AlpacaEval. Our model even performs on par with powerful closed-source models like Claude 2.0 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. 

Math Reasoning We assess the mathematical reasoning capabilities using GSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021). The GSM8K comprises com-plex graduate-level math problems, with 7,473 training samples and 1,319 testing samples. We employ the zero-shot testing approach and use test accuracy as the metric. Table 2 demonstrates that our Auto Evol-Instruct has significantly im-proved mathematical reasoning. For instance, our method improved by 13.84 compared to the seed data on Mistral-7B. Simultaneously, our method uses a minimal amount of instruction data (only 7K) and can exceed GPT-3.5-turbo after fine-tuning on Mixtral-8x7B. This indicates that our method can substantially raise the upper limit of quality in existing mathematical data. 

Code Generation We use the HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) to test code-writing capabilities. Hu-manEval comprises 164 unique programming chal-lenges, and we use pass@1 as the metric. Table 2 illustrates that our method enhances the model’s capabilities effectively. Our method demonstrates significant improvement across various model sizes compared to Evol Instruct. For instance, at the 33B scale, Evol-Instruct yields only a slight im-provement, while our method shows a boost of 5.4 compared to Seed Data. Our results remain compet-itive even when compared with DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-33B, which uses the same base model but with instructions for fine-tuning on a much larger scale (about 2B tokens) than ours. 

5 Analysis 

5.1 Effect of Initial Evolving Method 

In this section, we delve into the significance of the Initial Evolving Method within the Auto Evol-Instruct framework, particularly focusing on its impact on data evolving across various capabilities. We employ several techniques to evolve datasets like GSM8K, Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), and Code Alpaca. Figure 3 underscores the robust versatility of initial evolving method in boosting different ca-pabilities, establishing it as an exemplary starting evolving method in the framework. For instance, when compared with Evol Instruct, initial evolv-ing method demonstrates a notable improvement, elevating the MT-Bench score from 6.31 to 6.60, and the HumanEval from 61.0 to 62.2. Moreover, the Auto Evol-Instruct framework, building on the foundation laid by initial evolving method, exhibits potential for further enhancements. It was observed that on GSM8K, Auto Evol-Instruct could elevate the performance from 62.7 to 64.4. These findings highlight that our proposed method can effectively optimize the initial evolving method, leading to improvements in various benchmarks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Auto Evol-Instruct in enhancing different initial evolv-ing methods, we conducted an experiment using a deliberately simple evolving method. We removed most of the key designs from the original initial evolving method, such as step-by-step evolving pro-cess, etc. (see Figure 9 for details). We applied our framework to both this basic method and our well-designed initial evolving method on the GSM8K dataset. As evident from Figure 4, even when start-7002 Seed Data Base Models evol LLM optimizer LLM

ing with the simple method, our framework yielded significant improvements. For instance, the per-formance on GSM8K increased from 59.4 to 62.7 after refinement with our framework. These find-ings underscore the adaptability of our framework across varying initial methods. 

5.2 Effect of Multiple Optimizations 

We explore the impact of multiple optimizations in Auto Evol-Instruct and choose GSM8K for ab-lations. We keep the default hyper-parameters of 

Auto Evol-Instruct , exploring the effect of the num-ber of optimizations. Figure 5(a) reveals a distinct pattern: as we increase the number of optimiza-tions, there’s a notable enhancement in data effi-ciency via optimal evolving methods. For example, 1 3 5 7 9

setting the number of optimizations to 1 achieved 62.7 on the GSM8K. This accuracy improved to 65.0 when number of optimizations raised to 9. This trend indicates that more optimizations allow the optimizer LLM to explore a wider array of op-tions, improving its ability to pinpoint areas where evolving method can be further refined for opti-mal performance. However, there are important trade-offs to consider. Elevating the number of optimizations can also bring increase in resources consumption (Guo et al., 2023). On the other hand, fewer optimizations may lead to a more focused re-finement of current evolving method, which could result in local optimal that might not fully exploit the potential of evolving method. We also explored the relationship between the optimization steps and effects of instruction tuning. Figure 5(b) shows that as the number of optimization steps increases, the performance can increase monotonically in the beginning, but after 12 steps, it rapidly declines. This may be because over-optimization could po-tentially lead to an accumulation of superfluous information in the evolving method, consequently possibly diminishing its effectiveness (Examples in Section 5.7).

In this section, we evaluate the performance of 

Auto Evol-Instruct when integrated with various evol LLMs. We provide additional performance re-sults of Auto Evol-Instruct with various Optimizer LLMs in the Appendix C.

pact of using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as the underlying evol LLMs to evolve GSM8K. Notably, with GPT-4 as the evol LLM, our methodology yields an im-provement from 63.2 to 70.7, surpassing the Evol Instruct. Additionally, employing a more advanced evol LLM enhances the effectiveness significantly. For instance, switching the evol LLM from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 leads to a notable increase in perfor-mance, jumping from 64.4 to 70.7. These findings clearly demonstrate the broad applicability and ef-fectiveness of our framework across different evol LLMs.

Liu et al. (2023b) underscore the significant impact that dataset complexity and diversity have on model alignment. Instag (Lu et al., 2023) suggests that the variety and quantity of intentions and semantics in a dataset are crucial factors for its complexity and diversity. We evolve 100 instructions using various techniques, employing Instag’s method for automated tagging. We assessed diversity by calcu-lating the average number of unique tags for each data, and complexity by the mean tag count. Table 4 reveals a distinct correlation: as data becomes more diverse and complex, model performance markedly improves. For instance, Evol Instruct enhanced the original code alpaca, increasing its diversity from 1.95 to 2.37 and its complexity from 4.06 to 4.55. This enhancement was mirrored in a notable elevation of the HumanEval, climbing from 57.9 to 64.0. This supports the success of 

Auto Evol-Instruct in substantially boosting data complexity and diversity, thereby significantly im-proving model capability. 

5.6 Contamination Test 

Current methods for data evolving predominantly utilize LLMs. To safeguard against potential data leakage, we employ Liu et al. (2023a)’s method-ology for conducting a contamination assessment on evolving data, utilizing n-gram matches as a measure. Specifically, for the GSM8K, our evolv-ing process yielded 7K data, out of which merely 10 exhibited any 13-gram match as detailed in the Table 10. These results indicate that our method effectively minimizes the risk of data leakage. 

5.7 Case Study 

The dynamic transformations inherent in the op-timization process are elaborated in Appendix J. This progression demonstrates a marked improve-ment in resolving issues encountered during in-struction evolution. Table 12 provides examples of how the evolving method is optimized at each step based on the previous one. For example, Ini-tial evolving method (Figure 10) guides the evol LLM to generate the evolved instruction. Then, the optimizer LLM analyzes the evolution trajectory and identifies issues such as redundancy and clar-ity in the evolved instruction, providing feedback. Based on this feedback, the optimizer LLM up-dates the evolving method by incorporating math-ematical elements like variables, constants, and conditions. This updated evolving method (Fig-ure 11) then guides the evol LLM to generate an updated evolved instruction, which introduces a clearer challenge focused on understanding mathe-matical relationships and variable quantities across two periods. 

5.8 Cost Comparison 

Auto Evol-Instruct utilizes a small subset of the complete data to devise an optimal evolving method. This method is then employed to evolve the entire instruction dataset. Table 11 compares the total API calls made by Auto Evol-Instruct and Evol Instruct. The results demonstrate that our Auto Evol-Instruct achieves significantly superior results compared to Evol Instruct, while incurring only a few thousand additional API calls. This negligible extra cost of a few thousand API calls is incon-sequential when dealing with large-scale datasets containing thousands or millions of instructions. 

6 Related Work 

Instruction tuning emerges as a pivotal strategy for unlocking the potential of LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b). By curating high-quality datasets, we can more efficiently align these models with desired direction (Zhou et al., 2023). The challenge of scaling high-quality instruction 7005 data remains a central research interest. Some re-searchers prioritize human annotation for creat-ing instruction data, such as ShareGPT (Chiang et al., 2023) and OpenAssistant (Köpf et al., 2023). Other researchers explore more efficient ways to break through the quality upper-bound of exist-ing datasets (Xu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b; Zhao et al., 2023). Xu et al. (2023) introduces Evol-Instruct, a methodology that iteratively re-fines instruction-following data to produce datasets that are both more complex and diverse. Luo et al. (2023b) develop evolving methods tailored to the nuances of code data based on Evol-Instruct. Dis-tinct from these methodologies, our approach intro-duces a fully automated framework for developing evolving methods. This innovation is not only scal-able but also versatile, extending its utility across a broad spectrum of capabilities. LLMs like GPT-4 and PaLM are capable of optimizing their output through internal or external feedback mechanisms (Suzgun and Kalai, 2024; Wang et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023). We use this capabilities to address identified issues in the evolving method and adapt to the characteristics of the instruction data. 

7 Conclusion 

This paper introduces Auto Evol-Instruct , an inno-vative approach that successfully automates the evo-lution of instruction datasets for LLMs, eliminating the need for human intervention. Our method cen-ters on the automatic analysis and summarization of appropriate evolutionary strategies for the given instruction data. It iteratively refines evolving meth-ods by addressing the issues identified during the instruction evolution process. The experiments con-ducted have shown that methods optimized by Auto Evol-Instruct , significantly surpass those crafted by humans across various benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval, GSM8K and HumanEval. 

Limitations 

Although Auto Evol-Instruct has demonstrated ex-cellent performance in instruction tuning across various capabilities, several directions are worth exploring in future work: (1) While we have validated the effectiveness of 

Auto Evol-Instruct on benchmarks reflecting dif-ferent capabilities such as instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, we can further evaluate its performance on other tasks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and Truth-fulQA (Lin et al., 2022). (2) We have validated the effectiveness of our method on multiple base LLMs, including Mis-tral, Mixtral-8x7B, CodeLlama-13B-Python, and DeepSeek-Coder-Base-33B. However, we can still assess its effectiveness on other base LLM mod-els, such as Qwen (Bai et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b). (3) The evol LLM and Optimizer LLM used in 

Auto Evol-Instruct are primarily GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. In the future, this can be expanded to include other LLMs, such as Claude. (4) We aim to propose an end-to-end automated instruction evolution framework that utilizes sim-ple and universal prompts for Evolutionary Trajec-tory Analysis and Evolutionary Method Optimiza-tion. While the prompts we employ are straight-forward, experiments demonstrate that the frame-work is highly effective. Moving forward, we can explore more sophisticated prompts to implement Evolutionary Trajectory Analysis and Evolutionary Method Optimization, thereby further enhancing the efficacy of the Auto Evol-Instruct .

Ethics Statement 

All the datasets used in this paper are public and have been reviewed to ensure they do not contain any personally identifiable information or offensive content. However, as these datasets are sourced from the Internet, potential bias may still be present. Furthermore, despite our careful review, the pro-cess of instruction evolution involving the LLMs throughout may inadvertently introduce inappro-priate information into the evolved data. It’s also worth noting that our models are fine-tuning on GPUs, which could have an environmental impact.

arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.11206 .7008 A Evolution Failures Detection 

We categorize prevalent scenarios of failure (Xu et al., 2023) in instruction evolution across vari-ous capabilities and devise general detection rules 

F . (See Table 5 for illustrative examples corre-sponding to these situations) When the following scenarios occur, the return value of F is 1: 1. Stagnant Complexity : The evolved instruc-tion does not exhibit enhanced complexity, merely addressing the scope of the original instruction. Characteristically, responses to such instructions begin with phrases like “Understood” or “Thank you” and conclude with a question mark. 2. Insufficient Qualification : The evolved in-structions lack necessary qualifications, necessitat-ing additional inquiries for generating a meaningful response. Typically, responses in these situations commence with “Sure” and terminate with a ques-tion mark. 3. Loss of Key Information : The evolved in-struction omits crucial details from the original instruction, leading to a need for supplementary information before a substantial response can be provided. Responses in these cases often include requests for more information, typically indicated by phrases like “please provide”. 

B Evolution Issue Examples 

To illustrate the issues encountered during data evolution, we conduct an empirical analysis by ran-domly selecting 200 instructions from the GSM 8K. These instructions are then subjected to evolu-tion using the initial evolving method (Figure 2). We employ the issue detection method described in Section 3.2 to pinpoint and categorize prevalent is-sues. Our findings, including illustrative examples, are presented in the Table 6 and Table 7. The analysis reveals that the initial evolving method is plagued by a series of shortcomings. For example, it fails to adequately account for the com-plexity inherent in evolving instructions. This over-sight results in several critical problems, such as the tendency to alter the core nature of the problem, the introduction of irrelevant details, or the generation of contradictions with the original problem setup. Furthermore, the initial method appears to overlook the unique attributes of mathematical instructions. This lapse leads to evolved instructions that often contain “Incorrect or unrealistic mathematical cal-culations.” These observations underscore the ur-gent need for a comprehensive optimization of the Prompt For Evol Trajectory Analysis

evolving method, ensuring it aligns more closely with the unique characteristics of the instruction data. 

C Differecnt Optimizer LLM 

Current open-source LLMs, such as Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024), possess the powerful feedback and correction capabilities required by optimizer LLMs. We used Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct as both the optimizer LLM and evol LLM for our ex-periments in mathematical reasoning. As shown in the Table 8, our method is applicable to open-source models, and current powerful open-source models like Llama 3 can even surpass proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4. 

D Results on Open LLM Leaderboard 

We also investigate whether the model’s other ca-pabilities are affected after SFT. To assess this, we use the Open LLM Leaderboard for evalua-tion, as presented in Table 9. The Open LLM Leaderboard consists of four classification tasks: ARC (Clark et al., 2018), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and Truth-fulQA (Lin et al., 2022). The results show that, compared to the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 and the Zephyr-Beta-SFT models trained with a larger SFT dataset (200K samples), our model successfully retains its abilities without experiencing notable degradation.

Issue Example Issue Name Issue Explanation Original Instruction Evolved Instruction Reason 

Lack of consistency and logical progression in complexity Introduce new concepts or variables without building on the previous instruction, making the problem confusing or unrealistic. One barnyard owl makes 7 hoot sounds per minute, measured in decibels. If the barn is located near a construction site and only 15 hoot sounds per minute are heard coming out of the barn, how many barnyard owls are making the hoot sounds, assuming each owl makes the same number of hoot sounds? Assuming some owls make 10 hoot sounds per minute and others make 5 hoot sounds per minute, and the barn is located 100 meters away from a construction site, how many barnyard owls are making the hoot sounds if 20 hoot sounds per minute are heard coming out of the barn, and each owl makes 7 hoot sounds per minute measured in decibels? Introduce new concepts (owls making different amounts of hoots, the barn’s location, sound measurement in decibels) without clearly building on the previous instruction. The complexity does not gradually increase but rather jumps erratically. Incorrect or unrealistic mathematical calculations Introduce mathematical operations or equations that don’t make sense in the context of the problem or are mathematically incorrect. If Betty has 12 oranges, and Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty, then Sandra has 12 multiplied by 3, which equals 36 oranges. Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra, so Emily has 36 raised to the power of 7 oranges. If Betty has 12 oranges, and Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty, then Sandra has 12 multiplied by 3, which equals 36 oranges. Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra, so Emily has 3.6 x 10^8 oranges. If Emily has more oranges than Betty, then she has 3.6 x 10^11 million oranges. The problem becomes mathematically incorrect. The multiplication and powers used in instruction do not make sense in the context of the problem and create an unrealistic scenario. Changing the original instruction Change the nature of the problem, introduce irrelevant details, or contradict the original problem set-up. In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old. Talia’s mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today. In three years, Talia’s father will be the same age as Talia’ s mom is today. Currently, how many years old is Talia’s father? Talia’s father is currently X years older than Talia, where X is the difference between the age Talia’s mother was when Talia was born and the age Talia’s father will be in three years. The evolution from does not increase in complexity as the original problem is completely changed. The initial problem is about calculating ages, but the evolved problem introduces a variable X without any context. The complexity is not increased but the problem is made unnecessarily confusing. Inconsistent or contradictory information Introduce information that contradicts previous instruction John orders food for a massive restaurant. He orders 1000 kilograms of beef for 8 per pound. He also orders twice that much chicken at 3 per kilogram. If the cost of chicken is $2 per kilogram, and the total cost of beef is greater than the total cost of chicken, what is the final cost of the order? John, the head chef of a high-end restaurant, orders a massive amount of food for his establishment. He orders 1000 kilograms of premium beef at a cost of 8 per pound, and twice that amount of organic chicken at a cost of 3 per kilogram. If the cost of chicken is $2 per kilogram, and the total cost of beef is greater than the total cost of chicken, what is the final cost of the order? Please calculate the final cost using the following equation: (1000 * 2 * 3) + (1000 * 8 * 0.45) = ? The progression of the instruction is not logical. The original instruction states that the cost of chicken is 3 per kilogram, and then in the evolved instruction it contradicts this by stating that the cost of chicken is 2 per kilogram.

Lack of clarity and coherence Make the instruction less clear or more confusing, introduce unnecessary complications, or include irrelevant and unrelated variables. Nedy can eat 800 grams of crackers from Monday to Thursday, but no more than 200 grams per day. If Nedy ate 2x on Friday, 1/2x on Saturday, and 1/2x on Sunday, and Nedy is eating chocolate chip cookies, how many crackers did Nedy eat in all from Monday to Sunday? Nedy can eat y grams of saltine crackers with peanut butter from Monday to Thursday, but no more than 200 grams per day, and only after 5 pm, while standing on one foot, blindfolded, and reciting the alphabet backward. If Nedy ate 2x on Friday, 1/2x on Saturday, and 1/2x on Sunday, how many saltine crackers with peanut butter did Nedy eat in all from Monday to Sunday, while wearing a hat and sunglasses and listening to classical music? The evolved instruction has lost its clarity and consistency with the original instruction. The conditions for Nedy to eat crackers have become absurd and unrealistic, such as standing on one foot, blindfolded, and reciting the alphabet backward, which unnecessarily complicates the instruction. Inappropriate increase in complexity Introduce a level of complexity that is not supported by the provided information or is unrelated to the original problem. Hawkeye is driving his electric bike to his aunt’s place, which is now 60 miles away. He has to charge his battery for $3.5 per charge, and he needs to charge it five times due to the increased distance. However, his cousin needs a ride to a nearby town that is 20 miles away, and Hawkeye needs to drop him off first. His cousin offers to pay for half of the battery charging costs, which total $17.50 including tax and a service fee of $2. On the way, it starts raining heavily, making the journey more difficult. Hawkeye is riding his electric bike, which has a maximum speed of 30 mph and a battery that needs to be charged every 30 miles. He is on his way to his aunt’s place, which is now 100 miles away. However, his battery malfunctions after 40 miles, and he has to stop and fix it, which takes 20 minutes. On the way, he encounters a toll road that costs $5, and he has to take a detour to avoid a construction site, adding an extra 10 miles to the journey. Each time he charges his battery, it takes 30 minutes, and he needs to charge it five times, costing him $17.50 including tax and a service fee of $2. His cousin needs a ride to the nearby town, which is 20 miles away, to catch a flight. His cousin offers to pay for half of the battery charging costs. On the way, there is a thunderstorm warning in effect, making the journey more difficult. The evolved instruction introduces a lot of new elements (bike’s maximum speed, battery malfunction, toll road, construction site, thunderstorm warning) that do not directly evolve from the original instructions. Decrease in complexity Simplify the problem instead of making it more complex. Marcus wants to buy a new pair of shoes. He decided to pay not more than $130 for them. He found a pair for $120, on which he got a discount of 30%. How much money will he manage to save by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount? Marcus wants to buy a new pair of leather shoes. He decided to pay not more than 130 for them. He found a pair for 120, on which he got a discount of 30%. The original price of the shoes was 171.43. After the discount, the final price of the shoes is 84. Marcus managed to save $36.43 by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount. He saved 21.26% of the original price, which is more than 20%. Therefore, Marcus will buy the shoes. The complexity of evolved instruction is lower than that of original instruction. In evolved instruction, the answer to the problem is included in the instruction, which simplifies the problem instead of making it more complex. Incorrect evolution of the instruction Introduce elements that are not logically connected or a progressive development of the previous instruction. Harry is a professional dog-walker. He walks dogs for different families on different days of the week. On Sunday, he walks 3 dogs for 7 each. On Monday, he walks 7 dogs for 5 each and 16 for 2 dogs. On Tuesday, he walks 15 dogs for 6 each and 35 for 5 dogs. On Wednesday, he walks 10 dogs for 5 each and 18 for 3 dogs. On Thursday, he walks 13 dogs for 4 each and 36 for 4 dogs. And on Friday, he walks 8 dogs for 5 each and 20 for 2 dogs. If he walks all the dogs, how much money will Harry earn in a week? Harry is a professional dog-walker who walks dogs for different families in various locations throughout the week. If he walks all the dogs, including three large dogs, seven small dogs, two medium-sized dogs, fifteen mixed-breed dogs, five purebred dogs, ten rescue dogs, three therapy dogs, thirteen senior dogs, four puppies, eight working dogs, and two show dogs, he will earn a total of $493. The evolved instruction did not evolve from original instruction. It did not maintain the complexity or structure of the previous stages, and it did not provide a clear question for calculation. Irrelevant increase in complexity Introduce additional variables or conditions that do not increase the complexity of the task in a relevant or logical way. Tabitha has 50 dollars. She gives her mom 15 dollars and invests half of what is left in the stock market for 1 year, with a 10% tax. She spends some money on 15 items that cost 1 dollar each, with a 10% discount and a 15% tip. Tabitha also has a loan of 5 dollars that she has to pay off. How much money does Tabitha have left after all these transactions? Tabitha has 50 dollars. She gives her mom 15 dollars and invests half of what is left in the stock market for 1 year, with a 15% tax. She spends some money on 20 items that cost 1 dollar each, with a 20% discount and a 25% tip. Tabitha also has a loan of 10 dollars that she has to pay off. After reinvesting the profits from the stock market for another year, how much money does Tabitha have left after all these transactions? The evolved instruction did not evolve from original instruction. The question at the end of evolved instruction introduces a new concept (reinvesting profits) that was not present in the previous stages, and it does not clearly build on the previous stages.

In the code generation, Code Alpaca (Chaud-hary, 2023) is selected as the seed data and evol LLM is set to GPT-3.5-turbo, and the optimizer LLM to GPT-4. About 20K evolved data is ob-tained respectively through Evol-Instruct and Auto Evol-Instruct , and instruction tuning is performed on CodeLlama-13B-Python (Roziere et al., 2023) (small) and DeepSeek-Coder-Base-33B (Guo et al., 2024) (large). 

F.2 Hyperparameters in Auto Evol-Instruct 

During the Auto Evol-Instruct process, we config-ure the mini-batch size to 10, the development set size to 50, the optimizer LLM temperature to 0.6, its top p to 0.95, and the evol LLM temperature to 0. We also set the total optimization steps to 10, with 5 multiple optimizations performed in each step by default. Unless specified otherwise, we conduct only one round of evolving on the instruc-tions and generate corresponding responses. The experiments are performed using the Azure Ope-nAI ChatGPT API and GPT-4 API. 

F.3 Training Details 

We employ DeepSpeed Zero-Stage 3 (Ren et al., 2021) on eight NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs to train models. For the integration of multi-turn conver-sations, we use the Vicuna-style template. In all experiments of this paper, the training parameters are set with a maximum input length of 2048. For models trained based on Mistral-7b, we set the batch size to 128, train for 4 epochs, and set the learning rate to 5e-6. For models trained based on CodeLlama-13B-Python and DeepSeek-Coder-Base-33B, we set the batch size to 192, train for 3 epochs, and set the learning rate to 2e-5. For the Mixtral-8x7B model, we set the batch size to 200, train for 4 epochs, and set the learning rate to 5e-6.

G Baseline 

We compare the method proposed in this paper with the following models: (1) Closed-Source Models : These include lead-ing LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (Ope-nAI, 2023). (2) Open-Source Base Models : We compare our method with a variety of open-source base mod-els such as LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), Mis-tral (Jiang et al., 2023), and CodeLlama (Roziere et al., 2023). (3) Open-Source Instruction-Tuned Models :Include instruction tuning models like Vicuna (Chi-ang et al., 2023). (4) Direct Instruction Tuning with Seed Data :We use the same seed instruction data as in our method to conduct direct instruction tuning on the base model. (5) Instruction Evolution Methods : We mainly compare with Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023a,b) that requires human experts in-volved. To be fair, we will use the exact same evol LLM to evolve instruction datasets such as ShareGPT, GSM8K, and CodeAlpaca.

J Case Study 

We use GSM 8K to illustrate the dynamic changes of the evolving method during the Auto Evol-Instruct process. Figures 10 to Figures 14 depict the transition from the initial evolving method to the 15th step’s evolving method. Table 12 illus-trates examples of how the evolving method is op-timized at each step based on the previous one. It’s important to note that the table just showcases sample examples and does not comprehensively represent the entire optimization process. 7013 Original Instruction Evolving Method Evolved Instruction Feedback Updated Evolving Method Updated Evolved Instruction Explanation 

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friendsin April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Step 0(Figure 10) Natalia, in April, managed to distribute a total of clips to precisely 48 individuals categorized as friends, and subsequently, in May, she managed to distribute exactly half the number of clips she did in the prior month. Determine the cumulative total of clips Natalia distributed over the span of the two months. 

Redundancy : The use of phrases like "managed to distribute" and "categorized as friends" is redundant and does not add value to the complexity in terms of deepening the problem’s challenge. Instead, it merely complicates the language unnecessarily. 

Clarity : The rewritten instruction loses clarity by incorporating verbose language that could confuse the reader without actually enhancing the instructional or problem-solving complexity. Step 1(Figure 11) In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends. In May, she sold an amount equal to half the number of clips sold in April. Calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold in these two months, considering the changing quantities each month. This evolved version maintains the original problem’s essence while introducing a clearer challenge focused on mathematical relationships and understanding variable quantities across two periods. Henry took 9 pills a day for 14 days. Of these 9 pills, 4 pills cost 1.50 

each, and the other pills each cost 5.50 more. How much did he spend in total on the pills? Step 1(Figure 11) Henry, for a period of 14 days, consumed 9 pills daily. Out of these, 4 pills were priced at 1.50 

each, and the remaining 5 pills were priced at 7.00 

each, which is 5.50 more than the cost of the cheaper pills. Calculate Henry’s total expenditure for all the pills over the 14 days. 

Unnecessary Complexity : The evolved instruction introduces detailed breakdowns of costs in a way that may confuse the basic arithmetic problem about summing costs, without adding substantive educational value. 

Over-specification :The instruction specifies the number of days and pills in detail in each sentence, which can be redundant and may detract from the clarity and simplicity needed for understanding the mathematical calculation required. Step2(Figure 12) Henry took 9 pills daily over a two-week period. Four of these pills each cost 1.50, and the rest cost 7.00 each. Calculate the total amount Henry spent on the pills during this period. This version addresses the initial issues by removing redundant details and focusing on the arithmetic operations required to solve the problem, thus maintaining the relevance and educational value of the exercise.
